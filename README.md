## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to automate the configuration of web servers using Ansible to deploy a static website on AWS. By leveraging Ansible's powerful automation capabilities, we streamline the deployment process, ensuring consistency, efficiency, and reliability across multiple servers.

### Introduction:

### Why Automation?

Automation is a cornerstone of modern IT infrastructure management. Imagine having to configure 100 servers manuallyâ€”this process would be time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. Automation addresses these challenges by:

1. Enhancing Efficiency: Automate repetitive tasks to save time and resources.
2. Ensuring Consistency: Maintain uniform configurations across all servers, reducing discrepancies.
3. Improving Reliability: Minimize human errors, leading to more stable and predictable deployments.
4. Scaling Operations: Easily manage and scale infrastructure as your needs grow.

### Why Ansible?
Ansible is a powerful open-source tool for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. Its key benefits include:

1. Agentless Architecture: Operates over SSH, eliminating the need for agent installation on managed nodes.
2. Ease of Use: Uses simple YAML syntax for playbooks, making automation accessible even to those with limited coding experience.
3. Consistency: Ensures repeated runs achieve the same results, maintaining system consistency without unnecessary changes.
4. Extensibility: Integrates seamlessly with various platforms and services, including AWS, through its extensive module ecosystem.

3. #### Create Security Groups

Objective: Define firewall rules for your instances.

Actions:

Create security groups for the Bastion Host, Ansible Server, and Web Servers.

Configure inbound and outbound rules as per project requirements.

4. #### Create Keypairs

Objective: Secure SSH access to your instances.

Actions:

Generate SSH key pairs using ssh-keygen.

Store private keys securely and add public keys to AWS.

5. #### Add the Public SSH Key to GitHub

Objective: Enable secure access to your GitHub repositories from AWS instances.

Actions:

Navigate to GitHub settings.

Add your SSH public key for authentication.

6. #### Launch the Bastion Host Server

Objective: Provide a secure entry point to your AWS network.

Actions:

Launch an EC2 instance in the public subnet.

Configure security groups to allow SSH access.

7. #### Launch the Ansible Server in Private Subnet

Objective: Host Ansible for managing web server configurations.

Actions:

Launch an EC2 instance in the private subnet.

Assign appropriate security groups and IAM roles.

8. #### Launch the EC2 Instances (Web Servers) in the Private Subnets

Objective: Deploy web servers that will host the static website.

Actions:

Launch multiple EC2 instances in private subnets.

Configure security groups to allow necessary traffic.

9. #### Add the Private Key Pair to the Ansible Server

Actions:

Transfer the private key to the Ansible server.

Secure the key with appropriate permissions.

10. #### Create a GitHub Repository to Store the Ansible Playbook

Objective: Version control your Ansible automation scripts.

Actions:

Create a new repository on GitHub.

Clone the repository to your local machine and Ansible server.
