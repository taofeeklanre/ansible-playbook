## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to automate the configuration of web servers using Ansible to deploy a static website on AWS. By leveraging Ansible's powerful automation capabilities, we streamline the deployment process, ensuring consistency, efficiency, and reliability across multiple servers.

# Introduction:

## Why Automation?

Automation is a cornerstone of modern IT infrastructure management. Imagine having to configure 100 servers manuallyâ€”this process would be time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. Automation addresses these challenges by:

1. Enhancing Efficiency: Automate repetitive tasks to save time and resources.
2. Ensuring Consistency: Maintain uniform configurations across all servers, reducing discrepancies.
3. Improving Reliability: Minimize human errors, leading to more stable and predictable deployments.
4. Scaling Operations: Easily manage and scale infrastructure as your needs grow.

## Why Ansible?
Ansible is a powerful open-source tool for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. Its key benefits include:

1. Agentless Architecture: Operates over SSH, eliminating the need for agent installation on managed nodes.
2. Ease of Use: Uses simple YAML syntax for playbooks, making automation accessible even to those with limited coding experience.
3. Consistency: Ensures repeated runs achieve the same results, maintaining system consistency without unnecessary changes.
4. Extensibility: Integrates seamlessly with various platforms and services, including AWS, through its extensive module ecosystem.

The reference architecture for this project includes the following AWS resources:

1. VPC
2. Internet Gateway
3. NAT Gateway
4. Security Groups
5. Public and Private Subnets
6. EC2 Instances
7. Application Load Balancer
8. AWS Certificate Manager
9. Route 53

### Objectives
Building on our previous project, this Ansible project aims to:

1. Automate the configuration of web servers using Ansible.
2. Deploy a static website on AWS efficiently.
3. Achieve scalability, consistency, and reliability in deployment processes.
4. Utilize AWS services to support the infrastructure and deployment pipeline.
5. By the end of this project, you will have a fully automated process for deploying and managing a static website on AWS, leveraging the power and simplicity of Ansible.

### Prerequisites
